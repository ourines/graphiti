Use this tool to store any information that you want to remember for future conversations, such as:
- User preferences and settings
- Important facts about the user or their projects
- Decisions made during the conversation
- Context that should be retained across sessions

The memory will be processed and added to the knowledge graph, where it can be retrieved later using search_memory.

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Always use "default_user" as the group_id for personal conversations, or use a consistent project-specific ID (e.g., "project_keymize") for project-related memories. The group_id acts like a folder - memories in different groups are completely separate.`,

    description: `Search the graph memory for relevant facts and relationships.

Use this tool to retrieve information that was previously stored using add_memory. The search uses hybrid retrieval combining:
- Semantic search (meaning-based matching)
- Keyword search (exact term matching)
- Graph traversal (related entities and relationships)

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: You MUST specify group_ids to search in. Use ["default_user"] for personal memories. If you added memories to a different group_id, you must search in that same group to find them. Searching in the wrong group will return no results.

- start_time: Only return facts valid after this time (ISO 8601: "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z")

Use this tool to monitor the memory processing pipeline and troubleshoot issues. This shows:

‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: This will delete ALL episodes, entities, facts, and relationships for the specified group_id. This operation cannot be undone!

Use this tool to:
- Clean up test data (e.g., delete "test_group")
- Remove old project memories (e.g., delete "project_old")
- Clear a specific context while preserving other groups

This is safer than clear_graph because it only affects one group_id, leaving other memory workspaces intact.

Example: Delete "test_retry" group but keep "default_user" memories.`,

  {
    name: 'delete_fact',
    description: `Delete a specific fact (knowledge graph relationship/edge) from memory.

Use this tool to remove incorrect or outdated facts from the knowledge graph. This is more precise than delete_episode because:
- delete_episode: Removes an entire conversation/episode
- delete_fact: Removes only a specific extracted fact/relationship

You'll need the fact UUID, which you can get from search_memory results (each fact has a 'uuid' field).

Example scenarios:
- "The LLM incorrectly extracted that 'Alice works at Google' - delete that fact"
- "This relationship is no longer valid"
- "Remove duplicate or conflicting facts"

Note: This deletes the EntityEdge (fact) but keeps the entities (nodes) and episode intact.`,

Use this to inspect a fact's complete metadata, including:
- Source and target entities
- Relationship type and description
- Temporal validity (valid_at, invalid_at timestamps)
- Confidence scores
- Source episode that generated this fact

This is useful for:
- Debugging knowledge extraction quality
- Verifying fact accuracy before deletion
- Understanding fact provenance and timeline
- Auditing the knowledge graph

You'll need the fact UUID from search_memory results.`,

    name: 'list_groups',
    description: `List all memory workspaces (group_ids) in the knowledge graph.

Use this to discover what memory spaces exist. This is extremely helpful for:
- Finding all available groups before searching
- Avoiding typos in group_id (e.g., "default_user" vs "user_liubiao")
- Understanding the organizational structure of your memories
- Knowing which contexts have stored data

Example results: ["default_user", "project_keymize", "work", "personal"]

This solves the common problem: "I stored memories but can't find them because I forgot the group_id!"`,

  {
    name: 'get_entities',
    description: `Browse entities (people, places, concepts) in the knowledge graph.

Use this to see what the system has learned and extracted from your conversations. Returns entity nodes with:
- Entity name (e.g., "Alice", "GraphiTi", "Python")
- UUID for further querying
- Summary description
- Creation timestamp

This is useful for:
- Exploring what information has been extracted
- Verifying entity recognition quality
- Finding entity UUIDs for get_entity_relationships
- Understanding the knowledge graph structure
- Discovering connections you might have forgotten

Example: "Show me all entities in my 'work' memories" ‚Üí Returns Alice (colleague), Project X (project), Python (technology), etc.`,

  {
    name: 'get_entity_relationships',
    description: `Explore all relationships/facts connected to a specific entity.

Use this to understand how an entity connects to the rest of your knowledge graph. Returns all facts (EntityEdges) where this entity is either the source or target.

This enables powerful questions like:
- "What projects is Alice working on?" (get relationships for Alice entity)
- "What technologies are used in Project X?" (get relationships for Project X)
- "Who knows Python?" (get relationships for Python entity)

You need the entity UUID, which you can get from:
- get_entities results
- search_memory results (entities mentioned in facts)

Example workflow:
1. list_groups ‚Üí find "work" group
2. get_entities(group_id="work") ‚Üí find Alice entity with UUID abc-123
3. get_entity_relationships(uuid="abc-123") ‚Üí see all Alice's connections`,

    name: 'get_graph_stats',

This provides a high-level overview of your knowledge graph, including:
- Total episodes (conversations/memories stored)
- Total entities (people, places, concepts extracted)
- Total facts (relationships between entities)
- Total communities (topic clusters, if built)
- Oldest and newest memory timestamps

Use this to:
- Monitor knowledge graph growth over time
- Understand the size and scope of your memories
- Validate that memories are being stored correctly
- Get a quick health check of your knowledge graph

Example: "How big is my 'work' knowledge graph?" ‚Üí Returns comprehensive stats showing you have 145 episodes, 89 entities, 234 facts, etc.`,
