Use this tool to store any information that you want to remember for future conversations, such as:

- Important facts about the user or their projects
- Decisions made during the conversation
- Context that should be retained across sessions

The memory will be processed and added to the knowledge graph, where it can be retrieved later using search_memory.

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Always use "default_user" as the group_id for personal conversations, or use a consistent project-specific ID (e.g., "project_keymize") for project-related memories. The group_id acts like a folder - memories in different groups are completely separate.`,

- Semantic search (meaning-based matching)
- Keyword search (exact term matching)
- Graph traversal (related entities and relationships)

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: You MUST specify group_ids to search in. Use ["default_user"] for personal memories. If you added memories to a different group_id, you must search in that same group to find them. Searching in the wrong group will return no results.

- Use cases: "What did we discuss last week?", "Memories from January 2024"

üÜï MULTI-PROJECT SEARCH: Enhanced search capabilities for managing multiple projects!
- priority_group_id: Prioritize results from a specific project (e.g., "keymize" over "xiaoman")
- min_priority: Only return facts with priority >= this value (0-10 scale)
- tags: Filter by tags (e.g., ["#Rust", "#Â∑•ÂÖ∑"])

Use this tool to:
- Clean up test data (e.g., delete "test_group")
- Remove old project memories (e.g., delete "project_old")
- Clear a specific context while preserving other groups

- Understanding the organizational structure of your memories

üéØ Purpose:
This tool enables context-aware memory operations by setting which group_id should be prioritized in searches.

üîç How it works:
- Sets the active group_id for the current conversation
- Future search_memory calls will automatically prioritize results from this group
- Tracks recently used groups for easy context switching
- Auto-applied to add_memory operations

- "Switch to project keymize context" ‚Üí set_context(group_id="keymize")

- No need to manually specify priority_group_id in every search
- Reduces context-switching overhead
- Makes multi-project workflows more natural

üöÄ Purpose:
Efficiently add multiple memories in a single operation, ideal for:
- Importing conversation history
- Migrating data from other systems
- Bulk knowledge graph population
- Loading archived memories

‚ö° Performance:
- Processes all memories asynchronously
- More efficient than calling add_memory multiple times
- All memories processed in parallel queue

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:
- All memories must belong to the same group_id
- Each memory requires: name, content, timestamp
- Returns job IDs for tracking processing status

üí° Example workflow:
1. batch_add_memories with array of memories
2. Use get_queue_status to monitor processing
3. Search for imported memories after processing completes`,

    name: 'find_duplicate_entities',
    description: `Detect potential duplicate entities in the knowledge graph using semantic similarity.

üîç Purpose:
Identify entities that might represent the same real-world concept but have different names or representations.

üéØ Use cases:
- Data quality checks
- Deduplication before merging graphs
- Finding synonyms and aliases
- Identifying entities that should be merged

üìä Returns:
- Groups of similar entities with similarity scores
- Each group includes entity names, UUIDs, and similarity percentage
- Sorted by similarity (most similar first)

‚ö†Ô∏è Parameters:
- group_id: The workspace to check
- similarity_threshold: Minimum similarity (0.0-1.0, default: 0.85)
  - 0.95+ : Near-identical (typos, case differences)
  - 0.85-0.95 : Very similar (synonyms, abbreviations)
  - 0.70-0.85 : Somewhat similar (related concepts)
- limit: Maximum duplicate groups to return (default: 50)

1. find_duplicate_entities(group_id="work", similarity_threshold=0.9)
2. Review suggested duplicates
3. Use merge_entities to combine duplicates`,

    name: 'merge_entities',
    description: `Merge two duplicate entities into one, combining all their relationships.

üîß Purpose:
Consolidate duplicate entities by transferring all relationships from the source entity to the target entity, then deleting the source.

üéØ Use cases:
- Clean up duplicates found by find_duplicate_entities
- Merge entities with different spellings ("NYC" + "New York City")
- Consolidate synonyms or aliases
- Fix entity extraction errors

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:
- This operation is IRREVERSIBLE
- The source entity will be DELETED after merge
- All facts/relationships will point to the target entity
- The target entity's information is preserved
- The source entity's relationships are transferred

üí° Workflow:
1. Use find_duplicate_entities to identify duplicates
2. Review the entities to confirm they should be merged
3. Choose which entity to keep as target (usually the one with better name/summary)
4. Execute merge_entities(source_uuid, target_uuid)

  {
    name: 'batch_delete',
    description: `Delete multiple nodes (entities, episodes, or facts) in a single operation.

üöÄ Purpose:
Efficiently delete multiple nodes at once instead of calling delete operations individually.

üéØ Use cases:
- Clean up test data
- Remove multiple duplicate entities after review
- Delete batches of outdated episodes
- Mass cleanup operations

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:
- This operation is IRREVERSIBLE
- Can delete any combination of entities, episodes, and facts
- All relationships will be cleaned up automatically
- More efficient than individual deletes

üí° Workflow:
1. Collect UUIDs of nodes to delete (from search, get_entities, etc.)
2. Review the list to ensure you're deleting the right nodes
3. Execute batch_delete with the UUID list

üìä Example:
batch_delete(uuids=["uuid1", "uuid2", "uuid3"])`,

üéØ Use cases:
- Explore available tags before filtering
- Audit tag usage across your knowledge base
- Find inconsistent tag naming (e.g., "Python" vs "python")
- Understand how your knowledge is categorized

üìä Returns:
- tags: List of all unique tag strings
- count: Total number of unique tags
- entity_tags: Tags used on entities
- message: Summary message

üí° Example workflow:
1. list_tags(group_id="work") ‚Üí See all tags in work context
2. Find inconsistencies like "JavaScript" and "Javascript"
3. Use rename_tag to standardize naming`,

    name: 'rename_tag',
    description: `Rename a tag across all entities in the knowledge graph.

üîß Purpose:
Standardize tag naming by renaming a tag everywhere it's used.

üéØ Use cases:
- Fix typos in tags ("Pyton" ‚Üí "Python")
- Standardize capitalization ("javascript" ‚Üí "JavaScript")
- Consolidate similar tags ("#AI" ‚Üí "#ArtificialIntelligence")
- Rename project/category tags

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:
- Updates ALL entities with the old tag

- Can be scoped to a specific group_id or applied globally

üí° Workflow:
1. list_tags() ‚Üí Find tags that need renaming
2. rename_tag(old_tag="Javascript", new_tag="JavaScript")
